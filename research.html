Its academic mission centers around biostatistical excellence in clinical, epidemiological, and genetic studies.  Its faculty possess superior leadership skills in a variety of areas including clinical trials, cardiovascular biostatistics, multicenter study coordination, family and genetic studies of human diseases, computing, and statistical packages. The Division is well-equipped to provide assistance at the stage of preparing grant applications, including careful discussions of study design, sample size calculations, randomization schemes, computer resources and data analysis.  Biostatistical consultation represents an important activity of the division, providing expertise in all these areas on a fee for service basis.  The teaching and training component of the Division's mission is centered around a multi-disciplinary graduate training program in biostatistics, which provides training in biostatistics, genetic epidemiology, statistical genetics, and bioinformatics. The program was launched in 2011 with a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Biostatistics (MSIBS), which includes internship, statistical consulting lab,

and an optional thesis. The "Genetic Epidemiology Masters of Science" (GEMS) program which has been offered since 2002 has been integrated into the MSIBS program. The Division leads a post-doctoral training program in genetic epidemiology and a PRIDE summer institute program (Program to Increase Diversity among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research). </hr>

            <h2>Laying the Foundations</h2>
            <p>
Before the Division of Biostatistics was established in 1966 within the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, the curriculum for medical students included biostatistics as a component of the teaching program which was handled by Professor Helen T. Graham in the Department of Pharmacology (with the support of Dr. Carl F. Cori, Chairman of the department).  In 1946, Mrs. Barbara Hixon of the Department of Mathematics joined Professor Graham in developing and teaching the biostatistics component of the course.  A feature of the program was that it often utilized the results of the students laboratory experiments to demonstrate the statistical concepts.  In 1947, Dr. Oliver Lowry enthusiastically supported the program.

            <h2>The History of the Division of Biostatistics</h2>
            <p>
The Division of Biostatistics was established in 1966 within the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health to meet a variety of needs and to afford expanded opportunities and identity for biostatisticians within the setting of the Washington University School of Medicine.

The Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, under the Chairmanship of the late Dr. Robert E. Shank, sought to establish a new Division to support the ever-growing need for assistance for faculty and students in the design of experiments, analyses of data, and the application of more advanced biostatistical methodologies needed to secure grants from the National Institutes of Health. With the assistance of Dean M. Kenton King and several funding agencies, the Division was created and housed in Old Shriner's Children's Hospital building at 706 S. Euclid Avenue . More recently, an arm of the Division has been established in Barnard Hospital in the center of the Barnes complex to facilitate greater interaction with the Siteman Cancer Center and other Medical School collaborations.

            <h2>Research Activities </h2>
            <p>
collaborative projects with various departments of the Medical School, as well as independently funded multicenter epidemiological and family studies.  They span a wide range of topics dealing with a number of diseases of considerable public health importance.  Core research programs of the Division include genetic epidemiology, especially as it relates to genetic modeling of human diseases with particular emphasis on cardiovascular diseases and statistical modeling for Alzheimer’s disease and neuroimaging data.  Present collaborative research projects include: a multicenter family study to assess the genetic basis of response to exercise training (HERITAGE), a multicenter NETWORK study on the genetics of hypertension (HyperGEN), a large multi-ethnic Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP), a family and genetic study of salt sensitivity of blood pressure (GenSalt), a multi-ethnic study of gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiovascular traits (Gene-Lifestyle). Research resources and collaborative research programs include Biostatistics Core Resources in studies of Alzheimer's disease, the Washington University Institute of Clinical Sciences, and the Washington University Kennedy Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center.  Other research programs for which we serve or have served as data management and/or a coordinating component include the study of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (DOLF), the Silent Infart Transfusion (SIT), Study, Childhood Obesity (COMPASS) Study, Treatment of Anti-HLA Antibodies to Prevent BOS after Lung Transplant (HALT), the Minority Action Plan (DACC), and the Pride Coordination Core.
