         <p>Research activities of the Division of Biostatistics involve both independent and collaborative research which span a wide range of topics dealing with clinical, epidemiological, and genetic studies of a number of disorders of considerable public health importance, providing research opportunities at both theoretical and applied levels. Several research projects involve close interaction and collaboration with a number of research groups at the Medical Center. The present core research programs of the division deal with clinical trials, coordinating center activities, and genetic epidemiology of disease related complex traits.

The Clinical trials core research focuses on the development and implementation of research protocols for collaborative research both within the University and with collaborators across the country. The division actively contributes to all facets of the studies, including the design of the trials, sample size calculations, protocol development, database management, quality control, analysis of data, and manuscript preparation.</p>

            <h2>Gene-Lifestyle Interactions

</h2>
            <p>
The primary goal of the proposed research is to leverage existing GWAS and Exome Chip data in 27 large multi-ethnic cohorts to discover additional genetic loci for cardiovascular traits by modeling gene-lifestyle interactions, using pleiotropy analysis of correlated traits, and pathway analysis. The investigation will be carried out in over 150,000 samples of European Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asians. Approximately equal sample sizes will be used for replication.

Healthy Aging & Senile Dementia</h2>
            <p>
HASD is a program project based in the Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Neurology.  It has been continuously funded since 1984.  HASD is designed to explore correlates of preclinical Alzheimers Disease in persons 65 and older.  The Biostatistics Core, led by Chengjie Xiong, is one of five cores and four projects in HASD.  For more information, contact Dr. Xiong, or Betsy Grant, data manager, betsy@wubios.wustl.edu.

            <h2>Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network </h2>
            <p>
DIAN is an international research partnership of leading scientists determined to understand a rare form of Alzheimer’s disease that is caused by a gene mutation. Understanding of this form of Alzheimer's disease may provide clues to decoding other dementias and developing dementia treatments. DIAN currently involves ten outstanding research institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Washington University is the study coordinating center for this study.

            <h2>Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP) 

</h2>
            <p>
The Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP) is a large multi-center genetic study of high blood pressure and related conditions in multiple ethnic groups. The program in turn consists of four multi-center Networks: GenNet, GENOA, HyperGEN and SAPPHIRe. The FBPP has been funded since 1995 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI, an institute of the National Institutes of Health). The Division of Biostatistics at Washington University School of Medicine serves as the Program Data Center (PDC) for the FBPP.

Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network</h2>
            <p>
The Division of Biostatistics serves as the Data Coordinating Center for the HyperGEN Network whose primary goal is the study of the genetics of hypertension.  Detailed clinical exams and extensive genotyping were performed on large samples of affected sibpairs, mostly with stage 2 hypertension, and a random sample of subjects.

            <h2>GenSalt</h2>
            <p>
The GenSalt study is aimed at identifying novel genes which interact with the effect of dietary sodium and potassium intake or cold pressor on blood pressure.  The Department of Epidemiology at Tulane University serves as the Study Coordinating Center (SCC).  The Division of Biostatistics at Washington University School of Medicine heads the Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC).
